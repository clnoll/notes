#### Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

##### Part 1
If f is continuous on 􏰗$[a,b]$􏰘, then the function g defined by:
$$g(x) = \int_{a}^{b} g(t) ~ dt, ~{a ≤ x ≤ b}$$
is continuous on $[a,b]$ and differentiable on $(a,b)$ and $g'(x) = f(x)$.

##### Part 2
If f is continuous on 􏰗$[a,b]$􏰘, then
$$\int_{a}^{b} f(x)dx = F(b) - F(a)$$
where $F$ is any antiderivative $f$, that is, a function such that $F' = f$.

Here is some inline math: $\frac{d}{dt} t = 1$.

Here is some block math[ref]with a footnote.[/ref]:

$$\int \frac{sin \theta}{cos \theta} d\theta = -ln(cos \theta) + C$$
